## 🚀 How to Run the Edge AI Model

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies:
```
pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
```

### 2️⃣ Train model:
Open `train_model.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally.

### 3️⃣ Convert trained model to TFLite:
```
python convert_to_tflite.py
```

### 4️⃣ Test TFLite model:
```
python test_tflite.py
```
